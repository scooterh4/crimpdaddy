# :climbing: A Climbing Logbook Web App

A mobile-friendly react app that will allow users to log their climbs and see their progress over time. Hosted by Firebase.

Checkout my current deployment here at https://crimpdaddy-db2af.web.app/

## Features
- :bookmark_tabs: Users can log their climbs using an intuitive session-based logging system. Climbs can be added, edited or deleted within the session.
- :page_facing_up: Several pages display different climbing data based on what the user has logged.
- :bar_chart: The grade pyramids page shows users what grades they've been completing and attempting.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: The progression page shows users if they are improving on a monthly basis over time.
- :construction_worker: Another session page is being created that will display breakdowns of each session logged.

Happy climbing :)
